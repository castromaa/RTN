\section{Version 1.14.0}{
  \itemize{
    \item Concluded the VSE/EVSE pipeline, including examples.
    \item Improved computational performance and RTN workflows.
    \item {In order to improve stability and portability, all dependencies have 
    been extensively revised and, when available, replaced with more stable options.
    }
    \item { In order to simplify documentation and usability, some pipelines have 
    been revised and should be distributed as separated packages, or 'on demand', 
    focused on the main workflow, as for example the new 'RTNduals' package.
    }
